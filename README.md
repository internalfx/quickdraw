# Quickdraw

The idea for Quickdraw comes from the 'shopify_theme' gem. I use a lot of code from them.

### Features

- MUCH faster downloads and uploads. Quickdraw can download your files as much as 10x faster or more! Unfortunately, Shopify API call limits will slow you down. But in short bursts (10-20 files), Quickdraw is much faster.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'quickdraw'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install quickdraw
